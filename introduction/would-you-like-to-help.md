# Would you like to help?

Well, first you could tell me what you think about this guide. If you are reading on [gitbook.com](https://andybaba.gitbook.io/my-guide-to-flight-sim-dcs/), then you can rank every page separately. If you would like to help even more, leave a contact there too and I will get back to you as soon as I can to discuss it together.
