# Get Hands-on ASAP!

Check your system requirement, set up you gear, install the game and get flying.

## Check your Rig

If you are reading this already, then most probably you have [the minimum PC to get started](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/downloads/world/beta/). Well I did not, therefore I built a rig from the scratch. There are lots of content on building/upgrading your PC, specifically for DCS, whether you want to go down the track ID path or VR. However, At this moment, all I have to say is don't go cheap (as much as you can).

I understand, the prices are rocket high, but as we already know, [this hobby needs investing time and money](../introduction.md#why-should-you-read-me). I also did not pay 2000 euros just for a graphic's card (as a reference, [ASUS ROG STRIX GEFORCE RTX 4090 OC EDITION](https://www.alternate.nl/html/product/1870140?utm\_source=GoogleShopping\&utm\_medium=cpc\&utm\_campaign=GoogleShopping\_Grafischekaart\&utm\_term=JIXV0T01\&gclid=CjwKCAjw36GjBhAkEiwAKwIWyd-a8vyUQ5kouTB8gKEz7Y5S7wH1VOevo7SsIZpZXfMkIgrgqO9NXBoC4fEQAvD\_BwE) is around 2000 at the time of writing this), but think of it as your infrastructure, the stronger it is, the easier/enjoyable to grow on it later. If you have less than 45 FPS it will be more likely you quit without having any fun.

## Setup your Gear!

I wish I could tell you don't need anything else besides a PC and an internet connection. There are those who say although preferable are important, they are not a must. I completely disagree, you cannot get better at it and enjoy without the right tools (at least the minimum set).

<summary>First Stick</summary>

As I already mentioned in “[My first stick](http://localhost:5000/o/h4q1IgXjrHJ5jJVtyD3E/s/s2UzUqfq63SH5jchI40L/)”, I started with [LogiTech Extreme 3D Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Logitech\_products). I still think if you really are not sure if this is for you, then you can start from there.

\
If you are more confident, then I would suggest my first HOTAS (Hands On Throttle And Stick): [Logitech X56 H.O.T.A.S.](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/space/x56-space-flight-vr-simulator-controller.945-000058.html). It is a good value for the buck choice for the beginning. I must say I tried a [Thrustmaster Warthog](https://www.thrustmaster.com/nl-nl/products/hotas-warthog/) HOTAS for 2 weeks as well, but in the end, decided to return it and keep the Logitech set. And invest in a rudder pedal instead.
