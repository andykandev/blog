# Introduction

This guide covers almost everything I have learned, and constantly evolves as I gain more experience. It is organized from the fundamentals to advanced topics! Feel free to follow it in the same order from start to finish, as it shows how I am doing it, or you can dive straight into the specific topics that pique your interest.

<summary>Why should you read me?</summary>

Hopefully by now, you know, flying, real or virtual, is not a cheap hobby. Most importantly it needs a considerable amount of time to get started, get good at it and stay good at it. It also requires investment in a good rig, monitor/VR, peripherals, and software. Therefore, it is a good idea to approach it efficiently.\
My primary goal is to lay down a well structured and progressive path to enjoy flying in [Digital Combat Simulator](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/) (DCS). Secondly, get better at it. And last but not least, learn about aviation! You never know, someday you have to retire from the virtual air force then you might want to get a job, being a virtual airline pilot.
