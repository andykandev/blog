# Foreword

Hello and welcome! As a flight enthusiast (among other things), I've taken up the delightful task of creating this living README as a hobby project. Its purpose is to document my own learning progress, and hopefully to provide you, my fellow enthusiast, with a delightful learning experience (even smoother than mine).

So, secure your harness, and get ready to soar through this incredible learning adventure together! Hope to fly with you someday.

If you're interested to know about my story of aviation, read on, otherwise skip this section.

#### First Exposure

My first exposure was at the age of 8, before having my own PC. I played [F-117A Nighthawk Stealth Fighter 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-117A\_Nighthawk\_Stealth\_Fighter\_2.0) on DOS on my friend's i486. To be honest I donâ€™t remember much of it unless I watch the [gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_ij2WAaLPEM).

#### A Failed Attempt

At age 12, I upgraded to my second PC (from an i386 to a Pentium) with an optical drive (the games were on CDs back then). The first 2 games I bought were [Neverhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Neverhood) (one of the best games ever created!) and [Jane's F-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane's\_F-15). After a failed attempt to experiment my first flight with F-15 (That game was only playable with a joystick, and I did not have one), and almost 2 years later, I finally started with [Jane's USAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane's\_USAF) (which had keyboard support). It still is one of the best simulations created (think DCS but before 2000, here is a [gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaunZz6GfYE)).

#### My First Stick

I got into [MSFS 2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft\_Flight\_Simulator\_2004:\_A\_Century\_of\_Flight), after owning my first stick, a [Logitech Extreme 3D Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Logitech\_products).

#### And Now

[DCS Open Beta 2.8](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/downloads/world/beta/)
